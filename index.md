## What is Liquid?

Liquid is an open-source, Ruby-based template language created by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com). It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts.

Liquid has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used by many other hosted web applications. 

It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly as a plugin but it also works excellently as a stand alone library.
