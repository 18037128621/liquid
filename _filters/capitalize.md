title: capitalize
---

`capitalize` ensures the first character of your string is capitalized.

| Input                               | Output           |
|------------------------------------:|:-----------------|
| `{ "title" | capitalize }`          | "Title"          |
| `{ "my great title" | capitalize }` | "My great title" |

It only capitalizes the first character, so subsequent words will not be capitalized as well.
