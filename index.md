Liquid is an open-source template language created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts.

Liquid has been in production use at Shopify since 2006 and is now used by many other hosted web applications.
